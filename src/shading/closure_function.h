/*
 * The design of seperating actual closure function and the OSL closure interface
 * have the following CONS:
 * 
 * 1. Closures contain emissive ones that will also be sampled by light at some-
 *    where else, seperate the actually closure computation code to let light
 *    reuse it;
 * 2. Avoid slow vitual function.
